## Concepts

### Agile Methodology

Agile is a methodology for managing software development projects. It promotes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility to adapt to changing requirements. The Agile Manifesto outlines four key values and twelve principles to guide teams in delivering high-quality software.

**Agile Values:**

1. Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working Software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to Change over following a plan.

**Agile Principles:**

1. Customer Satisfaction: Deliver valuable software early and continuously.
2. Welcome Change: Embrace changing requirements, even late in development.
3. Frequent Delivery: Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales.
4. Collaboration: Business people and developers must work together daily.
5. Motivated Individuals: Build projects around motivated individuals and provide the environment and support they need.
6. Face-to-Face Communication: The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working Software: Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Sustainable Development: Maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Technical Excellence: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity: Maximize the amount of work not done.
11. Self-Organizing Teams: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. Reflect and Adjust: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly.

### Scrum Framework
Scrum is a framework within the Agile methodology. It is designed for teams to work on complex projects and deliver high-quality products incrementally. Scrum is built around a set of roles, events, and artifacts.

**Scrum Events:**

1. Sprint: A time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) where a potentially shippable product increment is created.
2. Sprint Planning: A meeting at the beginning of the sprint where the team plans the work to be done.
3. Daily Scrum: A 15-minute daily meeting for the team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
4. Sprint Review: A meeting at the end of the sprint where the team demonstrates the work done and gathers feedback.
5. Sprint Retrospective: A meeting at the end of the sprint where the team reflects on the past sprint and plans for improvements.

**Scrum Artifacts:**

1. Product Backlog: An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product.
2. Sprint Backlog: A list of tasks to be completed during the sprint, selected from the product backlog.
3. Increment: The sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint and all previous sprints.

### Roles in Scrum

Scrum defines three primary roles:

**Scrum Master**

- Facilitates Scrum events and ensures that the Scrum framework is followed.
- Helps the team to remove obstacles and improve processes.
- Acts as a coach for the team, ensuring they adhere to Agile principles.

**Product Owner**

- Represents the stakeholders and the voice of the customer.
- Manages the product backlog, prioritizes items, and ensures the team understands the requirements.
- Responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.

**Development Team**

- A cross-functional group of professionals who deliver the product increment.
- Self-organizing and accountable for the work done during the sprint.
- Collaborates to turn backlog items into increments of value.


## Summary
In this lesson, you learned about Agile methodology, including its values and principles. You explored the Scrum framework, which includes specific roles, events, and artifacts designed to help teams work more effectively on complex projects.
