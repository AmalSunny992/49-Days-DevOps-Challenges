## What is Git and how do we use it in DevOps:
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software
development. In DevOps, Git is used for version control, collaboration, and to automate code
deployments through CI/CD pipelines.


## Explain me the workflow of how you push your code from a local machine:
The typical workflow involves the following steps:

git add [files] : Stage changes for commit.

git commit -m "Message" : Create a commit with a descriptive message.

git pull origin [branch] : Fetch changes from the remote repository.

git push origin [branch] : Push changes to the remote repository.


## How do you revert a commit that you made in your repository:
Use git revert [commit_hash] to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous
commit.


## What is a branch in Repository:
A branch in a Git repository is a separate line of development that allows multiple developers to work
on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

## What cloud are you familiar with:
I'm familiar with AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, and GCP (Google Cloud Platform).


## What is a VPC in cloud:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network within a cloud provider's infrastructure that you
define and it allows you to isolate, control and deploy your resources, such as virtual servers and
databases.


## What is the difference between a Public and Private Subnet and what differentiates it:
A public subnet is accessible directly from the internet, while a private subnet is not. Public subnets
are typically used for resources that need public access, like web servers, while private subnets are used for resources that should not be directly exposed, like databases.

## What is the difference between reserved instance and spot instances:
Reserved instances are long-term reservations of compute capacity, offering a significant discount in exchange for a commitment.
Spot instances are spare capacity instances available at a lower price but can be terminated with short notice.


## What is CloudFormation:
AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and provision AWS infrastructure as code (IaC). 
You can create,update, and delete AWS resources using templates written in JSON or YAML.


## What are the popular IaC tools have you used:
I've used Terraform and AWS CloudFormation.


## What is the difference between Terraform and Ansible:
Terraform is primarily used for infrastructure provisioning and management, while Ansible is a configuration management and
automation tool.
Terraform focuses on describing the desired state of infrastructure, while Ansible defines how to configure servers.

## What is a playbook in Ansible:
A playbook in Ansible is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks and configurations to be executed on remote servers. It is used for
automation and configuration management.

## What is a state file in Terraform:
ðŸ’¡ The Terraform state file is used to keep track of the resources that Terraform manages. It stores information about the
current state of the infrastructure and helps Terraform plan and apply changes accurately.

## What is Terraform Remote state backend?
Terraform remote state is a mechanism that allows Terraform to store its state information in a centralized location, such as an
object storage bucket or a remote key-value store.

terraform {
backend "s3" {
bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
key = "terraform.tfstate"
region = "us-east-1"
encrypt = true
dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
}
}

Section 7 -
Container âš“
What is the difference between Virtualization and containerization:
Virtualization:
Running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server, each with its own operating system. It's like having separate
houses with different families in a single building.
Containerization:
Running isolated applications (containers) on a shared operating system. It's like having apartments in a single building, where
each apartment is self-contained but shares common infrastructure.

Explain the workflow of how a Docker Container is created?
Docker Container Creation Workflow:
1. Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile with application instructions.
2. Build Image: Use docker build to build an image from the Dockerfile.
3. Run Container: Run a container from the image using docker run .
4. Container: The container runs your application, isolated and self-contained.
How do you manage multiple containers:
I use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage multiple containers, ensuring high
availability, scalability, and load balancing.



What is CI and CD in CICD:
CI (Continuous Integration) is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes frequently. CD (Continuous
Deployment/Delivery) is the automated process of deploying code to production after successful CI.
What CICD tools have you used in the past:
I've used Jenkins, GitHub actions, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD in various projects.
How will you create a CICD pipeline to update the website or app on every commit
to a particular branch:
To create a CICD pipeline for this scenario, I would configure the following steps:
1. Set up a version control system (e.g., Git).
DevOps Interview Questions + Answers!! 23
2. Use a CICD tool (e.g., Jenkins) to monitor the repository for commits to a specific branch.
3. Configure automated tests to ensure code quality.
4. Build and package the application.
5. Deploy the application to a staging environment for further testing (if required).
6. If tests pass, automatically deploy the application to the production environment.
Additionally, implement rollback mechanisms and monitoring to ensure the production environment remains stable.
Section 9 -

What is a Blue Green Deployment:
A Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy where you have two identical environments (Blue and Green), and you switch
traffic between them when deploying new versions. This minimizes downtime and allows quick rollbacks if issues arise.
Explain Canary Deployment:
Canary Deployment is a strategy where a new version of an application is deployed to a small subset of users or servers, allowing
for testing and validation. If it performs well, it's gradually rolled out to the entire user base.
DevOps Interview Questions + Answers!! 25
What is the biggest issue you faced:
The most significant challenge I faced was managing a sudden influx of traffic during a product launch. We had to quickly scale our
application to handle the load, which involved optimizing database queries and adding more servers.
How do you scale your application:
I use auto-scaling groups in AWS or Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic
patterns and resource utilization.
How do you rollback if something fails:
ðŸ’¡ I roll back by deploying the previous version of the application or by using container orchestration tools to revert to the
last stable state. I also ensure comprehensive monitoring and alerts to detect failures early.
How do you automate Deployment:
I automate deployment using scripts and CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab
CI/CD. This includes building, testing, and deploying code automatically on every commit. Also
